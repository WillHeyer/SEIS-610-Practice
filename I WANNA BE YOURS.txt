I WANNA BE YOURS – JOHN COOPER CLARKEI wanna be your vacuum cleanerBreathing in your dustI wanna be your Ford CortinaI will never rustIf you like your coffee hotLet me be your coffee potYou call the shotsI wanna be yoursI wanna be your raincoatFor those frequent rainy daysI wanna be your dreamboatWhen you want to sail awayLet me be your teddy bearTake me with you anywhereI don’t careI wanna be yoursI wanna be your electric meterI will not run outI wanna be the electric heaterYou’ll get cold withoutI wanna be your setting lotionHold your hair in deep devotionDeep as the deep Atlantic oceanThat’s how deep is my devotion
